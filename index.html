                    <p>When students work with Dr. Hurley on a weekly basis, they receive more than just tutoring—they are mentored.</p>
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> is an ongoing, weekly partnership designed to provide consistent guidance, premium support, and long-term success.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tutoring</strong>, on the other hand, is ideal for short-term, as-needed assistance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For the first week, all students—regardless of their tutoring plan—gain access to the full suite of mentorship benefits (outlined below). This allows students to experience the added value of ongoing support, daily engagement, and a community of like-minded learners. After the trial period, students who commit to weekly mentoring will retain these premium benefits, while others can continue with flexible tutoring sessions tailored to their needs.</p>

I was often in his classroom during my free periods because the one-on-one tutoring was incredibly helpful. No other teacher that I’ve had has been able to explain concepts in such a clear and effective way. Dr. Hurley is far and away the best teacher I have ever had; he’s kind, helpful, and devoted to making sure his students succeed, and he knows what he’s talking about."

There never was a dull moment in these classes, and I walked away from them with confidence in my quantitative and coding abilities. I now study Statistics at Harvard and make use of the math and computer science skills that he instilled in me.

                        "Dr. Hurley's guidance helped me begin my journey as a programmer with confidence and I earned a 5 on the AP Computer Science exam. His personalized teaching style in Java was memorable, effective, and benefits me to this day as I develop Android apps for work."

                        "The one thing that I remember and appreciated most about Dr. Hurley as a teacher was his creativity. Whether it was his ability to always try and learn new ways of teaching, or his ability to explain a singular concept in multiple different ways, he always made sure to find a way to teach that would help each and every one of his students understand the material."

                        "Admittedly, I did not excel in the fields of mathematics while in high school, but having been one of Dr. Hurley’s students on two different occasions (albeit quite a few years ago), I can honestly say that despite my shortcomings, he provided an environment that fostered curiosity and engagement in a subject so many (including myself) find less than relatable. He did what I thought was impossible – made math fun. His approach is methodical and patient, all the while showing his students how to practically apply classroom teachings in the real world – whether it be through finance, engineering or technology. He certainly made a lasting impact on not only my education, but that of my peers."

I no longer felt scared of judgment when asking questions, and he always made learning fun. If there is one take away from my experience with Dr. Hurley, it’s that great teachers build confidence in the classroom!"

                        "Dr. Hurley was by far the most impactful teacher I had in high school. Not only was he extremely knowledgeable about the subject, but he also communicated in such a way that was not just clear, but effective in furthering my understanding. More importantly, he demonstrated that he truly cared for his students by going the extra mile whether it was offering late night review sessions before exams, or giving up his lunch to make sure I fully mastered a certain concept. I highly recommend Dr. Hurley to any student needing seeking a tutor, as I believe that he is not only the most qualified, but will be the most successful in delivering the results you are seeking."

                        "Dr. Hurley was able to effectively teach a large amount of material to me in a very short period of time. The fact that his Computer Science class was the only one I took and the only experience I had ever had with coding before becoming a Computer Science major in college is proof of that. On top of that he has a great sense of humor and makes coming to class and learning a part of your day to look forward to. I didn't realize how much Dr. Hurley had prepared me for college until way after the fact, I would recommend him if you not only want to learn the material but also enjoy the material."

It's difficult to find educators with the same level of energy and dedication that he has, and it really sparked my passion for what I do in college. Before I took AP Computer Science&nbsp;A under him, I felt lost and didn't know how to realize my passion for working with technology. Now I find myself in my fourth year of being successfully invested in a world renowned program, and I owe him many thanks for it."
