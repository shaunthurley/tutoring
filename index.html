              "Dr. Hurley's guidance helped me begin my journey as a programmer
              with confidence and I earned a 5 on the AP Computer Science exam.
              His personalized teaching style in Java was memorable, effective,
              and benefits me to this day as I develop Android apps for work."

              "Dr. Hurley is a fantastic teacher and tutor. I took two years of
              math and two years of computer science with him. I was often in
              his classroom during my free periods because the one-on-one
              tutoring was incredibly helpful. No other teacher that I’ve had
              has been able to explain concepts in such a clear and effective
              way. Dr. Hurley is far and away the best teacher I have ever had;
              he’s kind, helpful, and devoted to making sure his students
              succeed, and he knows what he’s talking about."

              "Dr. Hurley taught me both Pre-Calculus and AP Computer
              Science&nbsp;A. He not only was a phenomenal teacher, but he also
              was extremely enthusiastic about both subjects. There never was a
              dull moment in these classes, and I walked away from them with
              confidence in my quantitative and coding abilities. I now study
              Statistics at Harvard and make use of the math and computer
              science skills that he instilled in me. Learning to code can be a
              frustrating process, but Dr. Hurley introduced me to the art of
              programming in the best way I could have imagined."

              difficult classes like computer science and calculus. His teaching
              style makes him open to change and flexible enough to adapt to the
              needs of every student. I wish I could have him again at Harvard!"

              "The one thing that I remember and appreciated most about Dr.
              Hurley as a teacher was his creativity. Whether it was his ability
              to always try and learn new ways of teaching, or his ability to
              explain a singular concept in multiple different ways, he always
              made sure to find a way to teach that would help each and every
              one of his students understand the material."

              but Dr. Hurley’s kind spirit and passion for his students made me
              believe in myself! I no longer felt scared of judgment when asking
              questions, and he always made learning fun. If there is one take
              away from my experience with Dr. Hurley, it’s that great teachers
              build confidence in the classroom!"

              "Dr. Hurley was by far the most impactful teacher I had in high
              school. Not only was he extremely knowledgeable about the subject,
              but he also communicated in such a way that was not just clear,
              but effective in furthering my understanding. More importantly, he
              demonstrated that he truly cared for his students by going the
              extra mile whether it was offering late night review sessions
              before exams, or giving up his lunch to make sure I fully mastered
              a certain concept. I highly recommend Dr. Hurley to any student
              needing seeking a tutor, as I believe that he is not only the most
              qualified, but will be the most successful in delivering the
              results you are seeking."

              "Admittedly, I did not excel in the fields of mathematics while in
              high school, but having been one of Dr. Hurley’s students on two
              different occasions (albeit quite a few years ago), I can honestly
              say that despite my shortcomings, he provided an environment that
              fostered curiosity and engagement in a subject so many (including
              myself) find less than relatable. He did what I thought was
              impossible – made math fun. His approach is methodical and
              patient, all the while showing his students how to practically
              apply classroom teachings in the real world – whether it be
              through finance, engineering or technology. He certainly made a
              lasting impact on not only my education, but that of my peers."

              "Dr. Hurley was able to effectively teach a large amount of
              material to me in a very short period of time. The fact that his
              Computer Science class was the only one I took and the only
              experience I had ever had with coding before becoming a Computer
              Science major in college is proof of that. On top of that he has a
              great sense of humor and makes coming to class and learning a part
              of your day to look forward to. I didn't realize how much Dr.
              Hurley had prepared me for college until way after the fact, I
              would recommend him if you not only want to learn the material but
              also enjoy the material."

              "Having a teacher like Dr. Hurley in high school was a rare
              blessing. It's difficult to find educators with the same level of
              energy and dedication that he has, and it really sparked my
              passion for what I do in college. Before I took AP Computer
              Science&nbsp;A under him, I felt lost and didn't know how to
              realize my passion for working with technology. Now I find myself
              in my fourth year of being successfully invested in a world
              renowned program, and I owe him many thanks for it."
