                    <blockquote>"Dr. Hurley is a fantastic teacher that knew how to inspire his students and get them inspired to participate in normally difficult classes like computer science and calculus. His teaching style makes him open to change and flexible enough to adapt to the needs of every student. I wish I could have him again at Harvard!" - Ivor</blockquote>

                    <div class="placeholder"></div>
                    <blockquote>Dr. Hurley is a fantastic teacher and tutor. I took two years of math and two years of computer science with him. I was often in his classroom during my free periods because the one-on-one tutoring was incredibly helpful. No other teacher that I’ve had has been able to explain concepts in such a clear and effective way. Dr. Hurley is far and away the best teacher I have ever had; he’s kind, helpful, and devoted to making sure his students succeed, and he knows what he’s talking about. - Caitlin</blockquote>

                    <div class="placeholder"></div>
                    <blockquote>"Dr. Hurley taught me both Pre-Calculus and AP Computer Science A. He not only was a phenomenal teacher, but he also was extremely enthusiastic about both subjects. There never was a dull moment in these classes, and I walked away from them with confidence in my quantitative and coding abilities. I now study Statistics at Harvard and make use of the math and computer science skills that he instilled in me. Learning to code can be a frustrating process, but Dr. Hurley introduced me to the art of programming in the best way I could have imagined." - Zach</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"Dr. Hurley's guidance helped me begin my journey as a programmer with confidence and I earned a 5 on the AP Computer Science exam. His personalized teaching style in Java was memorable, effective, and benefits me to this day as I develop Android apps for work." - Tyler</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"The one thing that I remember and appreciated most about Dr. Hurley as a teacher was his creativity. Whether it was his ability to always try and learn new ways of teaching, or his ability to explain a singular concept in multiple different ways, he always made sure to find a way to teach that would help each and everyone of his students understand the material." - Spencer</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Admittedly, I did not excel in the fields of mathematics while in high school, but having been one of Dr. Hurley’s students on two different occasions (albeit quite a few years ago), I can honestly say that despite my shortcomings, he provided an environment that fostered curiosity and engagement in a subject so many (including myself) find less than relatable. He did what I thought was impossible – made math fun. His approach is methodical and patient, all the while showing his students how to practically apply classroom teachings in the real world – whether it be through finance, engineering or technology. He certainly made a lasting impact on not only my education, but that of my peers." - Brian</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"I was never very confident with my math skills in high school, but Dr. Hurley’s kind spirit and passion for his students made me believe in myself! I no longer felt scared of judgment when asking questions, and he always made learning fun. If there is one take away from my experience with Dr. Hurley, it’s that great teachers build confidence in the classroom!" - Taylor</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"Dr. Hurley was by far the most impactful teacher I had in high school. Not only was he extremely knowledgeable about the subject, but he also communicated in such a way that was not just clear, but effective in furthering my understanding. More importantly, he demonstrated that he truly cared for his students by going the extra mile whether it was offering late night review sessions before exams, or giving up his lunch to make sure I fully mastered a certain concept. I highly recommend Dr. Hurley to any student needing seeking a tutor, as I believe that he is not only the most qualified, but will be the most successful in delivering the results you are seeking." - Cole</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"Dr. Hurley was able to effectively teach a large amount of material to me in a very short period of time. The fact that his Computer Science class was the only one I took and the only experience I had ever had with coding before becoming a Computer Science major in college is proof of that. On top of that he has a great sense of humor and makes coming to class and learning a part of your day to look forward to. I didn’t realize how much Dr. Hurley had prepared me for college until way after the fact, I would recommend him if you not only want to learn the material but also enjoy the material." - Richie</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"Having a teacher like Dr. Hurley in high school was a rare blessing. It's difficult to find educators with the same level of energy and dedication that he has, and it really sparked my passion for what I do in college. Before I took AP Computer Science A under him, I felt lost and didn't know how to realize my passion for working with technology. Now I find myself in my fourth year of being successfully invested in a world renowned program, and I owe him many thanks for it" - Michael</blockquote>
